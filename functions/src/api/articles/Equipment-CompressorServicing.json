Regular maintenance ensures the safe and efficient operation of our compressors and extends their lifespan.</p>\n<h2>Scope</h2>\n<p>This SOP applies to all dive staff responsible for compressor maintenance. It includes instructions for changing air filters, conducting oil changes, and performing other routine maintenance tasks.</p>\n<h2>Services</h2>\n<h3>Final Air Filters (Lawrence Factor X65247)</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Frequency of Change</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Change filters every 30 hours of run time.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Procedure</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Filters are numbered 1 (right) and 2 (left); air flows into filter 1, then 2, then to the panel.</li>\n<li>Depressurize the system using the bleeder to the left.</li>\n<li>Open filter housings with a wrench. Excessive force indicates pressure in the system.</li>\n<li>Discard the filter from housing 1; move the filter from 2 to 1.</li>\n<li>Install a new filter into housing 2.</li>\n<li>Clean threads on caps, apply silicon grease to O-ring if needed, and reinstall caps without overtightening.</li>\n<li>Notify when down to 5 filters for reordering.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>!!! alert\n    When new filters arrive, mark the current inventory with an &quot;X&quot; for differentiation. Use marked filters first.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../Images/Compressors/Filters.jpg\" alt=\"Filters\">\n<img src=\"../Images/Compressors/FilterWrench.jpeg\" alt=\"Filter Wrench\"></p>\n<h3>Maintenance of the Nitrox Machine</h3>\n<p>!!! alert\n    Refer to the maintenance manual for detailed procedures and safety precautions before starting any maintenance tasks.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Annual / 500 Hours Maintenance</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Change air/oil separator annually, oil and oil filter every 500 hours.</li>\n<li>Drain old oil using a suitable container.</li>\n<li>Remove and replace oil filter.</li>\n<li>Refill with Nuvair 546 Oil.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Every 200 Hours</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Change air intake filter and blue filters.</li>\n<li>Note hours on new air intake filter with a marker.</li>\n<li>Change blue filters sequentially:<ul>\n<li>Silver E7-20 (1 micron).</li>\n<li>Red E5-20 (0.1 micron).</li>\n<li>Green E1-20 (0.003 ppm oil vapor).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Inspect bowls and elements for moisture and degradation.</li>\n<li>Lubricate new filter O-rings before installation.</li>\n<li>Clean housing interiors before reassembly.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>!!! note\n    Change one blue filter at a time to maintain correct order.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../Images/Compressors/NitroxBack.jpg\" alt=\"Nitrox Machine Filters\">\n<img src=\"../Images/Compressors/NitroxOil.jpg\" alt=\"Nitrox Machine Oil Drain\">\n<img src=\"../Images/Compressors/BlueFiltersMaint.jpg\" alt=\"Blue Filters\"></p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>Inventory Notification</strong>:<ul>\n<li>Notify management if only one filter is remaining or if there are only two gallons of oil left.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Maintenance of the Red Compressor</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Oil and Filter Change</strong>:<ul>\n<li>Change oil and filter every 90 hours.</li>\n<li>Drain oil using a suitable container.</li>\n<li>Replace oil filter; keep spills to a minimum.</li>\n<li>Refill with Secolube Tropics oil.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>!!! note\n    Hand-tighten the oil filter only to avoid difficulties in future removal.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Long-Term Maintenance</strong>:<ul>\n<li>Service intervals at 1000 and 2000 hours are performed by Chad.</li>\n<li>Notify management when these services are due.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Adherence to this SOP is essential for the upkeep and longevity of our compressors. Regular maintenance ensures operational efficiency and upholds safety standards.</p>\n<p>!!! warning\n    Working with compressed gas and maintaining breathing air systems involves inherent risks. Improper handling, usage, or maintenance can lead to serious injury or death. Adhere to safety protocols:</p>\n<pre><code>- Follow established SOPs and manufacturer guidelines.\n- Use correct tools and equipment.\n- Wear appropriate PPE.\n- Report any issues immediately.\n- Be familiar with emergency procedures.\n\nSafety and quality of air are paramount. Your diligence in maintenance is crucial for safety and operational efficiency.\n</code></pre>\n",
