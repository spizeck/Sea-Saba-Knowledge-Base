  "content": "<h1>SOP: Surface Support</h1>\n<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>This SOP outlines the key responsibilities and tasks for the Surface Support role. Surface Support plays a critical role in dive operations, ensuring the safety and preparedness of divers and equipment.</p>\n<h2>Responsibilities</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Review Contingency Plans</strong>: Collaborate with the Captain and Dive Guides to review contingency plans. Discuss roles and actions in scenarios such as increased current, dive aborts, or broken moorings.</li>\n<li><strong>Prepare the Boat for Diving</strong>: Ensure the boat is fully prepared by setting up dive flags, the current line, tag line, ladder, and other necessary equipment.</li>\n<li><strong>Check Tank Valves</strong>: Double-check that all tank valves are fully <strong>OPEN</strong> before divers enter the water.</li>\n<li><strong>Diver Assistance</strong>: Provide assistance to divers entering and exiting the water to ensure safety and efficiency.</li>\n<li><strong>Monitor Diver Safety</strong>: Continuously observe divers underwater by tracking their bubbles. This is a critical safety responsibility.<ul>\n<li><strong>Avoid Distractions</strong>: Refrain from napping or playing music if it interferes with monitoring divers.</li>\n<li><strong>Adapt to Current Changes</strong>: Regularly check the current line. If currents strengthen, extend the tag line by attaching additional floating line.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Housekeeping</strong>: While still maintaining situational awareness, perform the following tasks:</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Equipment Inspection and Maintenance</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Tool Kit Inspection</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Inspect and clean the tool kit after each use.</li>\n<li>Ensure all tools are present and in good working condition.</li>\n<li><strong>Notify immediately</strong> if tools are missing or broken.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Oxygen (O2) and First Aid Kits</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Check the O2 kit and first aid kit for completeness.</li>\n<li>Check the O2 pressure levels.</li>\n<li><strong>Notify immediately</strong> if anything is missing, needs service, or the O2 needs refilling. O2 kits can be refilled at the hyperbaric chamber.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>General Maintenance</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use Ospho on rust.<ul>\n<li><strong>Refer to instructions</strong> on how to use Ospho properly.</li>\n<li><strong>Avoid chemical usage</strong> without consulting the guides. Improper use can damage equipment or cause injury.</li>\n<li>Relying on informal advice like &quot;That&#39;s how I was told&quot; is not acceptable. Always verify instructions.</li>\n<li>Use the correct RainX for the windows if needed (specific RainX for plastic windows vs. glass. Using the wrong one will destroy the window).</li>\n<li>Other tasks as you see the need to keep the boats clean and organized.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>!!! WARNING\n    - <strong>Use PPE</strong> (Personal Protective Equipment) when using chemicals. You do NOT want Ospho in your eyes...</p>\n<h2>Operational Tasks</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Organize Weights and Belts</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tidy and organize the weights and belts to ease future use.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Prepare Tanks and Gear</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Organize tanks and gear for the next dive.</li>\n<li>Order more tanks/gear for the PM dive if needed. Stay organized.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Manifest Completion</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Accurately fill out all information on the dive manifest.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Personal Gear Preparation</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If applicable, have your own gear ready for the next dive.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>!!! note\n      - <strong>Be Vigilant</strong>: Surface support is a critical role that requires constant attention and vigilance.\n      - <strong>Communication</strong>: Promptly report any issues or shortages to ensure seamless dive operations.\n      - <strong>Notify Issues Immediately</strong>: This can&#39;t be stressed enough. We can&#39;t fix unreported issues.</p>\n",
