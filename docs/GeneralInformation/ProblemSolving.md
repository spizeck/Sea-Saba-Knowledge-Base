# Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Problem-Solving & Issue Escalation

---

## Purpose
To provide a clear, step-by-step framework that empowers all staff members to solve problems independently, minimizing unnecessary interruptions and efficiently using resources.

## Scope
This SOP applies to all employees who need assistance in troubleshooting issues or making decisions within the organization.

## Procedure

### 1. The 3-Minute "Google-First" Rule
- **Action**: Spend at least three (3) minutes researching your question or issue using available online tools (e.g., Google, ChatGPT).  
- **Objective**: Reduce simple, easily answerable questions directed at managers or executives.  
- **Benefit**: Allows team members to develop problem-solving skills and saves time for higher-level tasks.

### 2. The 3-Peer Rule
- **Action**: If you still need help after the initial research, consult at least three (3) peers—this can be coworkers within the company or knowledgeable individuals in public forums.  
- **Objective**: Encourage collaboration and leverage the collective experience of colleagues at similar levels.  
- **Benefit**: Creates a supportive knowledge-sharing environment and refines potential solutions before escalating an issue.

### 3. The 3-Question “1:3:1” Rule
If the issue remains unresolved and requires escalation, come prepared to address these three questions:

1. **What is the actual problem?**  
   Provide a clear and concise description of the issue (one or two sentences).

2. **What are three (3) possible solutions?**  
   Demonstrate you’ve given the problem thoughtful consideration by proposing multiple approaches or options.

3. **What do you recommend and why?**  
   Present your best guess or hypothesis, even if you’re not 100% certain. This encourages accountability and learning.

## Reporting & Accountability
- **Self-Assessment**: Before escalating any issue, verify you have completed Steps 1 and 2, and prepared answers for Step 3.  
- **Manager/Supervisor Review**: Supervisors will ensure adherence by asking staff if they have completed each step. Repeated failure to follow the SOP may result in additional coaching or disciplinary action.  

**All staff members are responsible for adhering to this SOP.**
