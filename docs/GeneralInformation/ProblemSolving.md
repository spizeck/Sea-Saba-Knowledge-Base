# Problem-Solving & Issue Escalation

## Purpose

To provide a clear, step-by-step framework that empowers all staff members to solve problems independently, minimizing unnecessary interruptions and efficiently using resources.

## Scope

This SOP applies to all employees who need assistance in troubleshooting issues or making decisions within the organization.

## Procedure

### 1. The 3-Minute "Google-First" Rule
- **Action**: Spend at least three (3) minutes researching your question or issue using available online tools (e.g., Google, ChatGPT).  
- **Objective**: Reduce simple, easily answerable questions directed at managers or executives.  
- **Benefit**: Allows team members to develop problem-solving skills and saves time for higher-level tasks.

### 2. The 3-Peer Rule
- **Action**: If you still need help after the initial research, consult at least three (3) peers—this can be coworkers within the company or knowledgeable individuals in public forums.  
- **Objective**: Encourage collaboration and leverage the collective experience of colleagues at similar levels.  
- **Benefit**: Creates a supportive knowledge-sharing environment and refines potential solutions before escalating an issue.

### 3. The 3-Question “1:3:1” Rule
If the issue remains unresolved and requires escalation, come prepared to address these three questions:

1. **What is the actual problem?**  
   Provide a clear and concise description of the issue (one or two sentences).

2. **What are three (3) possible solutions?**  
   Demonstrate you’ve given the problem thoughtful consideration by proposing multiple approaches or options.

3. **What do you recommend and why?**  
   Present your best guess or hypothesis, even if you’re not 100% certain. This encourages accountability and learning.

## Accountability

- **Self-Assessment**: Before escalating any issue, verify you have completed Steps 1 and 2, and prepared answers for Step 3.
- **Manager/Supervisor Review**: Supervisors will ensure adherence by asking staff if they have completed each step. Repeated failure to follow the SOP may result in additional coaching or disciplinary action.

All staff members are responsible for adhering to this SOP.
