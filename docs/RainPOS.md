#### 3.3 Once you do this in Junglebee you will also need to do it in Rain POS, to refund the ticket in our system.
 This is easiest if they have the receipt with them, because you can scan the barcode at the bottom of their receipt and it will automatically pull up their transaction.
- If they do not have the receipt, then you need to click on Reports, End of Day, and then search the day that they bought the ticket, and find their receipt in the system.
