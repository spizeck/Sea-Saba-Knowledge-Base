# SOP: Surface Support

## Introduction

This SOP outlines the key responsibilities and tasks for the Surface Support role. Surface Support plays a critical role in dive operations, ensuring the safety and preparedness of divers and equipment.

## Responsibilities

- **Review Contingency Plans**: Collaborate with the Captain and Dive Guides to review contingency plans. Discuss roles and actions in scenarios such as increased current, dive aborts, or broken moorings.
- **Prepare the Boat for Diving**: Ensure the boat is fully prepared by setting up dive flags, the current line, tag line, ladder, and other necessary equipment.
- **Check Tank Valves**: Double-check that all tank valves are fully **OPEN** before divers enter the water.
- **Diver Assistance**: Provide assistance to divers entering and exiting the water to ensure safety and efficiency.
- **Monitor Diver Safety**: Continuously observe divers underwater by tracking their bubbles. This is a critical safety responsibility.
    - **Avoid Distractions**: Refrain from napping or playing music if it interferes with monitoring divers.
    - **Adapt to Current Changes**: Regularly check the current line. If currents strengthen, extend the tag line by attaching additional floating line.
- **Housekeeping**: While still maintaining situational awareness, perform the following tasks:

## Equipment Inspection and Maintenance

1. **Tool Kit Inspection**:
    - Inspect and clean the tool kit after each use.
    - Ensure all tools are present and in good working condition.
    - **Notify immediately** if tools are missing or broken.

2. **Oxygen (O2) and First Aid Kits**:
    - Check the O2 kit and first aid kit for completeness.
    - Check the O2 pressure levels.
    - **Notify immediately** if anything is missing, needs service, or the O2 needs refilling. O2 kits can be refilled at the hyperbaric chamber.

3. **General Maintenance**:
    - Use Ospho on rust.
        - **Refer to instructions** on how to use Ospho properly.
        - **Avoid chemical usage** without consulting the guides. Improper use can damage equipment or cause injury.
        - Relying on informal advice like "That's how I was told" is not acceptable. Always verify instructions.
        - Use the correct RainX for the windows if needed (specific RainX for plastic windows vs. glass. Using the wrong one will destroy the window).
        - Other tasks as you see the need to keep the boats clean and organized.
!!! WARNING
    - **Use PPE** (Personal Protective Equipment) when using chemicals. You do NOT want Ospho in your eyes...

## Operational Tasks

1. **Organize Weights and Belts**:
    - Tidy and organize the weights and belts to ease future use.

2. **Prepare Tanks and Gear**:
    - Organize tanks and gear for the next dive.
    - Order more tanks/gear for the PM dive if needed. Stay organized.

3. **Manifest Completion**:
    - Accurately fill out all information on the dive manifest.

4. **Personal Gear Preparation**:
    - If applicable, have your own gear ready for the next dive.

!!! note
      - **Be Vigilant**: Surface support is a critical role that requires constant attention and vigilance.
      - **Communication**: Promptly report any issues or shortages to ensure seamless dive operations.
      - **Notify Issues Immediately**: This can't be stressed enough. We can't fix unreported issues.
