# Dive Briefing Overview

**Dive Site Name:** (Include any interesting stories or facts about the site.)

## Dive Logistics:
- **Maximum Depth & Estimated Time of Tour:** (Include maximum allowable time if necessary.)
- **Dive Guides & Group Management:** (Details on identifying guides and how groups will be split.)
- **Buddy System Enforcement:** No solo diving allowed. Divers without a buddy must stay close to a guide.
- **Weight Checks:** First-time divers must check their weights at the tag line immediately upon entering the water.

## Tour Details:
- **Route & Highlights:** (Describe the planned route and what divers can expect to see.)
- **Boat Location Communication:** How guides will indicate the boat's location during the dive.
- **Post-Tour Instructions:** What divers can do before ascending and when should they ascend.

- **Meeting Points:** (Options for group assembly, ensuring clarity on where and how to meet.)
  - Meet at the surface at the mooring line, descend as a group.
  - Meet at the surface at the tag line, descend as a group.
  - Meet on the mooring line, 15 feet deep, descend as a group.
  - Buddy teams can descend and meet under the boat / base of the mooring. Experienced buddy teams only!

## Marine Park Guidelines:
- Strict no-touching, collecting, or contact policy. Be mindful of buoyancy and fin placement. No gloves.

## Safety and Equipment:
- **Decompression:** No decompression dives, unless specifically planned and certified to do so.
- **Dive Computer Requirement:** Essential for monitoring air, depth, and deco. Follow the computer's instructions for accidental deco stops.
- **Air and Depth Monitoring:** Divers are responsible for monitoring their air supply and depth.
  - Alert your guide upon reaching half tank.
  - Plan your ascent to return to the boat with at least 500 psi / 50 bar.
  - Perform a safety stop for 3-5 minutes, depending on maximum depth reached.
- **Reiterate Entry and Exit Procedures:** Especially taking fins off on the tag line when rough.

## Additional Notes:
- **Guide Responsibilities:** Ensure constant guide presence in or near the water as divers enter.
- **Group Management:** If feasible, sort groups by skill level or air/nitrox usage to minimize underwater congestion. Advanced or nitrox divers usually enter the water first.
- **Guided Dive Protocol:** The tour begins only when all divers are assembled with the guide.
- **Air Consumption-Based Tours:** Adapt the tour to match divers' air consumption rates.
- **Dive Computer Usage:** Make sure everyone understands how to use their dive computer. Provide guidance for rental units if necessary.
- **Compliance with Safety Stops:** Failure to comply with mandatory safety stops will result in a no-dive penalty for at least 24 hours.
- **Handling Accidental Decompression:** Requires a 2-hour surface interval, possibly affecting subsequent dive plans.
- **Cancellation and Rescheduling Policy:** Dives cancelled by the diver (due to deco, feeling unwell, etc.) are not refundable or exchangeable, though rescheduling may be possible at the company's discretion.
- **Surface Interval Timing:** Schedule surface intervals strategically to maintain the dive day's flow without rushing the pre-dive briefing.
- **Site Specific Procedures:** Be aware of any specific procedures for individual dive sites.

### Dive Flexibility:
- Experienced buddy teams may have the option to diverge from the group, subject to the dive site conditions and the discretion of the Captain/Dive Guide.
