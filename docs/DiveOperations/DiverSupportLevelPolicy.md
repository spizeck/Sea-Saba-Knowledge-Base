# Diver Support Level Policy

## Purpose

Diver support levels are used to plan safe, enjoyable dives by matching guide attention, group structure, and dive conditions to each diver's needs. These levels reflect current experience, comfort, and situational factors, not certification level alone.

Support levels may vary by trip, conditions, or over time.

## Scope

This SOP applies to all dive staff involved in manifest planning, dive briefings, and in-water guide assignments.

## Procedure

### Support Level Definitions

#### Independent

**Definition**: Divers who are comfortable and competent managing their own dive within agreed parameters.

**Typical Characteristics**:

- Excellent buoyancy and trim
- Strong situational awareness
- Comfortable in current, surge, and variable conditions
- Manages gas, depth, and ascent independently
- Familiar with or adaptable to local conditions

**Operational Notes**:

- May dive without close supervision when conditions allow
- Still required to follow dive plan and safety procedures
- Not a substitute for local regulations or guide requirements

#### Guided

**Definition**: Capable divers who benefit from a guide for navigation, site knowledge, and group coordination.

**Typical Characteristics**:

- Good buoyancy and control
- Comfortable in open water environments
- Prefers or requires guided dives
- Benefits from local knowledge and group pacing

**Operational Notes**:

- Standard guided group placement
- Normal guide-to-diver ratios apply
- Most visiting recreational divers fall into this category

#### Assisted

**Definition**: Divers who benefit from closer attention and proactive support during the dive.

**Typical Characteristics**:

- Average recreational experience
- May have inconsistent buoyancy or awareness
- Benefits from regular check-ins and slower pacing
- May be returning after a break from diving

**Operational Notes**:

- Positioned closer to the guide
- More frequent monitoring
- May influence site choice or dive profile

#### Supported

**Definition**: Divers requiring enhanced support due to experience level, comfort, medical considerations, or situational factors.

**Typical Characteristics**:

- New or low-experience divers
- Divers with anxiety, physical limitations, or special considerations
- Divers requiring assistance with equipment, buoyancy, or task loading

**Operational Notes**:

- Requires dedicated or near-dedicated guide attention
- May require modified dive plans, sites, or conditions
- Support level is situational, not permanent

### Assignment Guidelines

Support levels are determined by:

1. **Recent dive experience**
2. **Observed skills** (buoyancy, awareness, comfort)
3. **Environmental conditions**
4. **Medical or situational considerations**

!!! warning
    Certification level alone does not determine support level. Guides may adjust support level during or after a dive for safety and enjoyment. Support levels may change from dive to dive.

### Guest-Facing Statement

> Support levels indicate the amount of guide support planned for the dive and are based on recent experience, comfort, and conditions.

This statement can be included anywhere guests might see the manifest.

### Internal Reminder for Staff

!!! note
    Support levels are planning tools, not labels. They exist to:

    - Improve safety
    - Improve guest experience
    - Reduce stress for divers and staff

## Accountability

All dive staff are responsible for accurately assessing and assigning diver support levels. The Captain and Dive Guides share responsibility for reviewing assignments before each dive and adjusting as conditions or observations warrant.
