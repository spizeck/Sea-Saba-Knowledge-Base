# Morning Routine for Dive Crew

## 1. Opening Procedures

Upon arrival, the crew is responsible for getting the dive shop ready for the day. This involves a series of steps to ensure everything is accessible and operational.

### Unlocking the "Dungeon"
The first task is to remove the padlock from the "dungeon," making sure that the area is accessible for equipment storage and retrieval.

### Opening the Shutters
The crew needs to open the shutters for multiple areas:
- The compressor room.
- The dive center.
- The equipment room.

!!! note
      - Captains and Managers have keys.
      - The controls for the Equipment room are inside the Dive Center.

## 2. Preparing the Trucks

After opening up the dive shop, the next step is to prepare for the day's diving trips. This involves loading the trucks with all necessary equipment and making sure that everything is accounted for.

!!! note
      - If both trucks are available, it is beneficial to load each boat onto a separate truck. 
      - Please do not overload the trucks. Make two trips if needed.

### Retrieving the Manifests
Collect the manifests for the day to determine the needs for tanks and equipment.

### Loading Tanks
- Ensure there are enough tanks for all manifested divers and staff.
- Include a spare tank for emergencies.
- Remember to account for tanks left on board from previous dives.
- When in doubt, it's better to take extra tanks.

### Equipment Boxes
- Load equipment boxes for divers onto the trucks. These should have been prepared based on the previous day's signup but check for any last-minute additions.
- For new divers or last-minute signups, ensure that their equipment boxes are prepared that morning.
- It's advisable to prepare an extra box with a variety of sizes in rental equipment for any size changes that may be needed. If a size change occurs, remember to update the manifest accordingly.

### Packing List
Refer to the [packing list](PackingLists.md) to ensure nothing is forgotten.

## 3. Getting the Boat(s)

By this time in the morning, the Captain(s) will have determined which dock to bring their boat to for loading. While the small pier is preferred for its ease of loading and unloading equipment and guests, availability can vary. On occasions where space is limited, we may need to tie two boats side by side and cross-load equipment. Generally, we aim to accommodate all boats for the day at the small pier, though minor modifications to the process may be necessary.

### Process Overview

1. **Dinghy Preparation**: One person is tasked with retrieving the dinghy, while the remainder of the team accompanies the trucks to the designated dock. The dinghy will then be used to transport one captain and one crew member for each boat from the dock to their respective vessels, which are moored offshore. Afterward, the dinghy is securely stored away, and the person responsible assists with further preparations.

2. **Preparation at the Dock**: While the dinghy is in use, the rest of the crew begins unloading tanks from the truck onto the dock, preparing for the boats' arrival.

### Tasks Upon Reaching the Boat

Upon arrival at the boat, the captain and the accompanying crew member must complete a series of essential tasks to ensure the vessel is ready for the day:

- **Power Up**: Turn on the battery switches to power up the boat.
  
- **Engine Preparation**: If applicable, trim the engines down, start them to warm up, and verify that everything is functioning correctly.

- **Communications and Electronics**: Activate the radio and other necessary electronics, performing a radio check to ensure communication lines are open and clear.

- **Safety and Mooring Preparations**:
  - Deploy the fenders to protect the boat during docking.
  - Prepare to release the boat from its mooring by ensuring all lines are ready and secure for a smooth departure to the dock.

### Final Preparations

- Once the captain has confirmed that the boat is ready and safe for docking, the crew member releases the mooring and prepares the lines for the boat's arrival at the dock.

This process ensures that each boat is prepared with efficiency and safety in mind, ready for a day of diving adventures.

## 4. Loading the Boat(s)

When the boat has docked, it's crucial to follow a systematic process for loading, rather than hastily moving items onboard. The captain—or a designated individual—plays a pivotal role in organizing this process to ensure both efficiency and safety.

### Initial Steps

- **Equipment Verification**: The Captain (or designated person) starts with the manifest to verify the guest equipment (crates) and establish the seating arrangement for the day. This step is fundamental for organizing the loading process and ensuring a smooth operation.

- **Seating Arrangement**: Carefully arranging the seating is essential, especially when the group size necessitates multiple guides. If there are more than 8 guests, indicating two guides will be in the water, it’s important to split the group accordingly. Guests should be seated with their group and other divers they are traveling with to facilitate a natural and streamlined experience.

### Loading Process

- **Equipment and Tanks**: Only after seating and equipment arrangements have been decided are tanks loaded onto the boat. Each guest's equipment is set up on their designated tank, starting from the tank furthest towards the bow and moving towards the stern as the day progresses. For divers stationed at the stern (if side spaces are full), equipment setup moves from the starboard side to the port side (left to right when facing the equipment).

- **Staff Gear**: Simultaneously, water jugs, coolers, and staff gear/tanks can be loaded, with staff tanks always placed at the stern of the boat.

### Safety Checks

- **Regulator and Tank Inspection**: For guests using air tanks, connect the regulator, pressurize to check for leaks, then depressurize. This step is crucial for identifying and fixing any leaking tank o-rings before the area becomes crowded with guests.

### Final Preparations

- **Double-Check**: Ensure that all necessary equipment and supplies are on board before guests arrive. This includes a final check of the equipment, tanks, and additional supplies to avoid any delays or issues during the trip.

- **Prepare to Receive Guests**: With everything in place, the crew should be ready to welcome guests onto the boat, guiding them to their designated seating and briefing them on safety procedures.

This organized approach to loading the boats not only ensures a smooth start to the day's activities but also enhances the overall guest experience by prioritizing safety and efficiency.
