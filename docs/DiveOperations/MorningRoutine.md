# Morning Routine for Dive Crew

## 1. Opening Procedures

Upon arrival, the crew is responsible for getting the dive shop ready for the day. This involves a series of steps to ensure everything is accessible and operational.

### Unlocking the "Dungeon"
The first task is to remove the padlock from the "dungeon," making sure that the area is accessible for equipment storage and retrieval.

### Opening the Shutters
The crew needs to open the shutters for multiple areas:
- The compressor room.
- The dive center.
- The equipment room.

!!! note
      - Captains and Managers have keys.
      - The controls for the Equipment room are inside the Dive Center.

## 2. Preparing the Trucks

After opening up the dive shop, the next step is to prepare for the day's diving trips. This involves loading the trucks with all necessary equipment and making sure that everything is accounted for.

!!! note
      - If both trucks are available, it is beneficial to load each boat onto a separate truck. 
      - Please do not overload the trucks. Make two trips if needed.

### Retrieving the Manifests
Collect the manifests for the day to determine the needs for tanks and equipment.

### Loading Tanks
- Ensure there are enough tanks for all manifested divers and staff.
- Include a spare tank for emergencies.
- Remember to account for tanks left on board from previous dives.
- When in doubt, it's better to take extra tanks.

### Equipment Boxes
- Load equipment boxes for divers onto the trucks. These should have been prepared based on the previous day's signup but check for any last-minute additions.
- For new divers or last-minute signups, ensure that their equipment boxes are prepared that morning.
- It's advisable to prepare an extra box with a variety of sizes in rental equipment for any size changes that may be needed. If a size change occurs, remember to update the manifest accordingly.

### Packing List
Refer to the [packing list](DiveOperations/PackingLists.md) to ensure nothing is forgotten.

## 3. Getting the Boat(s)

By this time in the morning, the Captain(s) will have determined which dock to bring their boat to for loading. While the small pier is preferred for its ease of loading and unloading equipment and guests, availability can vary. On occasions where space is limited, we may need to tie two boats side by side and cross-load equipment. Generally, we aim to accommodate all boats for the day at the small pier, though minor modifications to the process may be necessary.

### Process Overview

1. **Dinghy Preparation**: One person is tasked with retrieving the dinghy, while the remainder of the team accompanies the trucks to the designated dock. The dinghy will then be used to transport one captain and one crew member for each boat from the dock to their respective vessels, which are moored offshore. Afterward, the dinghy is securely stored away, and the person responsible assists with further preparations.

2. **Preparation at the Dock**: While the dinghy is in use, the rest of the crew begins unloading tanks from the truck onto the dock, preparing for the boats' arrival.

### Tasks Upon Reaching the Boat

Upon arrival at the boat, the captain and the accompanying crew member must complete a series of essential tasks to ensure the vessel is ready for the day:

- **Power Up**: Turn on the battery switches to power up the boat.
  
- **Engine Preparation**: If applicable, trim the engines down, start them to warm up, and verify that everything is functioning correctly.

- **Communications and Electronics**: Activate the radio and other necessary electronics, performing a radio check to ensure communication lines are open and clear.

- **Safety and Mooring Preparations**:
  - Deploy the fenders to protect the boat during docking.
  - Prepare to release the boat from its mooring by ensuring all lines are ready and secure for a smooth departure to the dock.

### Final Preparations

- Once the captain has confirmed that the boat is ready and safe for docking, the crew member releases the mooring and prepares the lines for the boat's arrival at the dock.

This process ensures that each boat is prepared with efficiency and safety in mind, ready for a day of diving adventures.
