# Morning Routine for Dive Crew

## 1. Opening Procedures

Upon arrival, the crew is responsible for getting the dive shop ready for the day. This involves a series of steps to ensure everything is accessible and operational.

### Unlocking the "Dungeon"
The first task is to remove the padlock from the "dungeon," making sure that the area is accessible for equipment storage and retrieval.

### Opening the Shutters
The crew needs to open the shutters for multiple areas:
- The compressor room.
- The dive center.
- The equipment room.

!!! note
      - Captains and Managers have keys.
      - The controls for the Equipment room are inside the Dive Center.

## 2. Preparing the Trucks

After opening up the dive shop, the next step is to prepare for the day's diving trips. This involves loading the trucks with all necessary equipment and making sure that everything is accounted for.

!!! note
      - If both trucks are available, it is beneficial to load each boat onto a separate truck. 
      - Please do not overload the trucks. Make two trips if needed.

### Retrieving the Manifests
Collect the manifests for the day to determine the needs for tanks and equipment.

### Loading Tanks
- Ensure there are enough tanks for all manifested divers and staff.
- Include a spare tank for emergencies.
- Remember to account for tanks left on board from previous dives.
- When in doubt, it's better to take extra tanks.

### Equipment Boxes
- Load equipment boxes for divers onto the trucks. These should have been prepared based on the previous day's signup but check for any last-minute additions.
- For new divers or last-minute signups, ensure that their equipment boxes are prepared that morning.
- It's advisable to prepare an extra box with a variety of sizes in rental equipment for any size changes that may be needed. If a size change occurs, remember to update the manifest accordingly.

### Packing List
Refer to the [packing list](DiveOperations/PackingLists.md) to ensure nothing is forgotten.
