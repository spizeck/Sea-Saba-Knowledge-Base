# SOP: Compressor Maintenance

## Purpose

This SOP outlines the procedures for routine maintenance of the compressors used at Sea Saba. Regular maintenance ensures the safe and efficient operation of our compressors and extends their lifespan.

## Scope

This SOP applies to all dive staff responsible for compressor maintenance. It includes instructions for changing air filters, conducting oil changes, and performing other routine maintenance tasks.

## Services

### Final Air Filters (Lawrence Factor X65247)

1. **Frequency of Change**:
    - Change filters every 30 hours of run time.

2. **Procedure**:
    - Filters are numbered 1 (right) and 2 (left); air flows into filter 1, then 2, then to the panel.
    - Depressurize the system using the bleeder to the left.
    - Open filter housings with a wrench. Excessive force indicates pressure in the system.
    - Discard the filter from housing 1; move the filter from 2 to 1.
    - Install a new filter into housing 2.
    - Clean threads on caps, apply silicon grease to O-ring if needed, and reinstall caps without overtightening.
    - Notify when down to 5 filters for reordering.

!!! alert
    When new filters arrive, mark the current inventory with an "X" for differentiation. Use marked filters first.
