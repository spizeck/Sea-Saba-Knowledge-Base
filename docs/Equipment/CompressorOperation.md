# SOP: Compressor Operations

## Purpose

The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to ensure the safe, efficient, and consistent operation of the compressors used in diving operations at Sea Saba. This SOP provides detailed instructions on operating the compressors, handling associated equipment, and performing routine maintenance tasks. It is designed to uphold the highest standards of safety and quality in our diving services.

## Scope

This SOP applies to all dive staff at Sea Saba who are involved in compressor operations. It covers the procedures for:

- Starting and operating the compressors for air and nitrox filling.
- Performing routine checks and maintenance of the compressors, including oil level checks, air filter inspection, and condensate drainage.
- Ensuring the proper arrangement and filling of diving tanks.
- Adhering to safety protocols to prevent accidents and equipment damage.

All dive staff members are required to familiarize themselves with these procedures and adhere to them strictly during their compressor room duties.

## Operational Procedure

1. **Turn on the Equipment**:
    - Turn on the breakers for the fans and Compressor 3 (Red Max-Air) when filling air. 
    - If filling nitrox, also turn on the Nitrox breaker.
    - Plug in the heater and dryer (located behind the air dryer on the wall). 
    - Turn on the dryer (blue machine) to allow it to warm up.

2. **Check Air Filter and Oil Change Status**:
    - Refer to the dry erase board for air filter and oil change status.
    - The Nitrox Blue Filters are tracked with the Nitrox Machine Hour meter.
    - The Red Compressor and Air Filters are tracked with the Red Compressor Hour meter.
    - Refer to [Compressor Servicing](Equipment/CompressorServicing.md) for more information about changing oil and filters.

3. **Check Oil Levels**:
    - The Red Compressor has 2 sight glasses. The oil should be approximately halfway up the top sight glass.
    - The Nitrox compressor has a screw-in dipstick. The oil should be on the hatch marks.
    - If necessary, top up the oil. The Nitrox compressor takes Nuvair 546 oil and the Red Compressor takes SecoLube Tropics. Notify if you had to top up the oil.

4. **Drain Condensate**:
    - Both the dryer and red compressor have bottles that collect condensate.
    - The dryer’s condensate (only water) can be emptied outside.
    - The red compressor’s condensate must be emptied into a used oil container for proper disposal.

5. **Wipe Down the Machines**:
    - Wipe any grease and grime off every day. This makes it easier to spot maintenance issues.
    - Alert management if you spot anything of concern.

6. **Starting the Compressors**:
    - After approximately 5 minutes of warming up the dryer, start the compressors.
    - For air filling, start directly. For Nitrox, bleed the system until the air reaches the appropriate oxygen percentage.
    - Bleeding the system is done by opening one of the fill whips to atmosphere.
    - Watch the Oxygen Sensor to monitor the Oxygen percentage. It is normal on startup for the Oxygen percentage to start around 32% before falling to near 21% and then rising again. You can start filling when the percentage exceeds 31%. 
    

!!! note
      - Target percentage is 32.3% +/-. You can adjust using the regulator on the Nitrox machine. 
      - Ensure that the Oxygen Sensor is calibrated! This can be done by taking off the cap and setting the percentage to 20.9%

7. **Arrange Tanks for Filling**:
    - Arrange the tanks in rows of 8, typically 3-4 rows deep.
    - Connect the fill whips to the row furthest from the wall for efficient operation.

8. **Filling Procedure**:
    - Takes 20-30 minutes to fill a row of 8 tanks.
    - Fill tanks from the bank and compressor until pressure stabilizes, then close the bank to let the compressor finish the job.
    - Once full pressure (3300 psi hot) is reached, close the tank valve and open the appropriate bank (Bank 1 for Air, Bank 2 for Nitrox). 
    - Switch tanks and repeat the process. If stepping away, consider filling the banks (max 3000 psi).
    - For tanks-only filling, the system will auto-shut at 4500 psi. Restart the red compressor after switching tanks and opening the bank valve.
    - The Nitrox compressor will not shut down as it supplies enriched air to the high-pressure (red) compressor.

!!! alert
      - **Never open both banks simultaneously!**
!!! warning
      - **Maximum Pressure**: Be aware that the max pressure in the banks is 3000 psi with no auto shutoff. Pay close attention.
      - **Pressure Regulation**: The pressure to tanks is regulated at 3300 psi; when this is reached, the valve will close, back pressuring the system.
      - **Restarting Compressors**: If the compressor shuts down at 4500 psi, it’s OK, but avoid making it a habit. Ensure the tank valves are closed before opening the bank valve and restarting the compressor.

## Conclusion

Strict adherence to this SOP ensures the safe and efficient operation of our compressors. Your diligence and attention to detail are crucial in maintaining the high standards of Sea Saba’s diving operations.
