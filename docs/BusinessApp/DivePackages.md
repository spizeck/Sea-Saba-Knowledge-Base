## How Multi-Day Dive Discounts Work

Our multi-day dive discounts are designed for guests diving on a mostly continuous schedule.

- To keep logistics efficient and equipment properly staged, we allow **one rest day** during a multi-day dive package.
- Taking more than one day off between dive days requires re-handling and re-staging equipment, and the **multi-day discount will reset**.
