  - For a comprehensive view of bookings, I recommend selecting "Calendar">"Customer View". This view displays 4 weeks of bookings categorized by type.

  - Different colors represent various booking types, providing quick visual references.

## 3. Searching for a Booking:
  - To search for a booking by name, locate and click on the search icon in the top right corner of the dashboard.

  - You will have better luck searching by the last name of the customer, if trying to find a specific booking.
## 4. Creating a New Booking:
  - To create a new booking, you have two options:
  - Click on the "+" buttons on the desired day and activity option.
  - Navigate to the "Booking" tab and select "New Booking".
## 5. Creating a Booking via "+" Button:
  - Clicking on the "+" button takes you to a page for that specific day and activity you would like to book.
  - This way is great for single day activities like Snorkeling or Sunset Cruises.

<src style="color: red;"> **Cash must be in exact change, because we cannot use the cash from the drawer. It will make your drawer count off at the end of the day.**

**Either put the cash with a note paper clipped to it with the name of the customer, or put in an envelope with the name of the customer and stick in the safe.**

## 12. Completing the Booking:
  - After processing payment, the system captures and it sends the guest and emailed receipt.
## 13. Waivers and Documents:
  - Guest must complete required waivers for items that they booked.
  - Use the iPad (In the Retail Shop) with Chrome to access the "Document Directory" 
  - Click "Sign Document" (for the activity they booked), for guests to fill out the waiver information.
